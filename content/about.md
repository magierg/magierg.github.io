# About InvertAssert

**InvertAssert.dev** is a space for thinkers, builders, and breakers.

Founded by a **Senior QA Engineer** with a passion for **automation**, **AI**, and **clean code**, this site explores what it means to deliver quality in an age where machines help test machines.

## Why “InvertAssert”?

In testing, `assert` means to confirm something is true.  
But here, we ask: **What if it’s not?**

The best QA doesn’t just confirm — it **inverts assumptions**, seeks **uncertainty**, and builds confidence through code.

This philosophy powers everything shared here:
- **Frameworks** grounded in SOLID principles
- **Playwright**, **k6**, **Python**, **Typescript**, and beyond
- **AI-enhanced testing** strategies, responsibly explored
- CI/CD, data testing, performance, and edge-case hunting

## Who Am I?

I'm a QA professional who:
- Breaks things so they don’t break in prod
- Automates the boring stuff
- Believes test code should be as clean as app code
- Keeps one eye on logs and the other on the future

If you’re into thoughtful testing, meaningful automation, and AI that helps—not hypes—welcome to **InvertAssert**.
